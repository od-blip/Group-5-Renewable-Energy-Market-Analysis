## **Data Cleaning**

### Steps Taken:
1. **Removed Duplicates**: Identified and removed any duplicate entries to ensure each response was unique.
2. **Standardized Column Values**: For open-ended responses, standardized answers using **Replace Values** to create consistent entries and replaced any blank spaces with "No Response" for completeness.
3. **Renamed Columns**: Simplified column names to make the dataset more readable and easier to reference in analysis steps.

## **Data Transformation**

### Steps Taken:
1. **Split Multiple-Selection Columns**: Used **Split by Delimiters** to separate multiple-selection (checkbox) answers into individual columns. Null cells were replaced with `0` for consistency, and all newly created columns were appropriately renamed for clarity.
2. **Converted Rating Scales**: Transformed qualitative ratings (e.g., "Not Important" to "Very Important") into numerical values ranging from **1–5** for easier aggregation and analysis of importance factors.

## **Analysis and Visualization**

### Methods and Techniques:
1. **Counting Checkbox Data**:
   - Used `COUNTIF` in Excel to count occurrences in multiple-selection columns, including:
      - Preferred Products
      - Expected Support Options
      - Additional Feature Preferences
   - Created three charts based on these counts to visualize preferences for products, support options, and valued features.

2. **Budget Range Analysis**:
   - Created a **Pivot Table** to calculate and display the percentage distribution of each budget range, allowing us to gauge pricing expectations across respondents.

3. **Consumer Demographics**:
   - Analyzed the **Age Group** and **Consumer Type** fields using pivot tables to determine the frequency of each category and calculate the percentage share of each group.

4. **Transaction Preferences and Challenges**:
   - Used pivot tables to display preferences for payment methods and document the main challenges faced by respondents, giving insight into common pain points.

5. **Trend Analysis for Age Group and Consumer Type**:
   - Analyzed the **frequency trends** within both the age group and consumer type categories to understand the dominant consumer profiles.
